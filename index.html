      La Gargola is a blacksmiths workshop that has been open since 1977. It was first owned by Cristobal Marin. Later when his son, Alfonso Marin, came of age he inherited the workshop and worked alongside his brothers Juan Marin and Daniel Marin. Around this time is when sculptures were also being made and put to sell and exposition.
